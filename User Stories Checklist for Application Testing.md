This checklist consolidates the user stories identified in your thesis (Section 9.1) and refines them for clarity and testability. Use the "Status" and "Notes" columns to track the implementation and testing progress of each function.

**Legend for Status:**
*   **Not Started:** Development has not begun for this feature.
*   **In Progress:** Feature is currently under development.
*   **Developed:** Feature development is complete, but not yet tested.
*   **Tested - Pass:** Feature has been tested and works as expected.
*   **Tested - Fail:** Feature has been tested and has issues. Details should be in "Notes".
*   **N/A:** Not Applicable (if a user story is deemed out of scope or redundant for the current phase).

### **2. Workflow Document and Test Checklist**

This document outlines the major business process workflows described in your thesis (Sections 8.2 and 10.1). Each workflow is broken down into key steps, forming a checklist to verify the correct functioning of the application's overall process flow.

**Legend for Status:**
*   **Not Started:** Testing for this workflow has not begun.
*   **In Progress:** This workflow is currently being tested.
*   **Completed - Pass:** Workflow executed successfully, all steps functioned as expected.
*   **Completed - Fail:** Workflow execution encountered issues. Details should be in "Notes".
*   **N/A:** Not Applicable.

#### **2.1 User Authentication and Authorization Workflow**

This workflow covers the basic user interactions for accessing the system. (Based on Tables 18, 19, 20)

### **How to Use These Checklists for Reporting Progress:**

1.  **Initial State:** Before starting development or testing, all "Status" fields will be "Not Started".
2.  **During Development:** As features are implemented, update the "Status" for individual user stories to "In Progress" or "Developed".
3.  **During Testing:** Once a feature or workflow is ready for testing, update its status.
    *   If it works, mark as "Tested - Pass" or "Completed - Pass".
    *   If there are issues, mark as "Tested - Fail" or "Completed - Fail" and provide detailed information in the "Notes" section (e.g., "Login button unresponsive," "Incorrect stock calculation for Variant B"). This allows developers to reproduce and fix the issues.
4.  **Reporting:** To report on progress, you can use metrics such as:
    *   **User Stories Completed:** Count of "Tested - Pass" stories.
    *   **Workflows Completed:** Count of "Completed - Pass" workflows.
    *   **Overall Progress:** (Number of 'Pass' items / Total number of items) * 100%.
    *   **Identified Issues:** Count of "Tested - Fail" or "Completed - Fail" items.
    *   **Burn-down/Up Charts:** Visually track the number of completed items over time.

This structured approach will provide clear visibility into the project's adherence to requirements and its current state, making it easier to identify gaps and manage the development process.
